# This is just a test.

What calls for special attention is that the image path should be like this:

> /images/posts/2024-10-15-FirstMd/image.png

not like this:

> images/posts/2024-10-15-FirstMd/image.png

or this:   (though it seems to be correct, it is not in the logic of this website)

> ../images/posts/2024-10-15-FirstMd/image.png


**As a result, we should delete the first two dots before images but keep the first slash(/).**
